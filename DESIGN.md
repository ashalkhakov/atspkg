# Dependencies
- [ ] Need an actual dependency solver
# Packaging
- [ ] Need a strategy for packaging/distributing package indices
  - [ ] Also need something like `.hats` files so that libraries can be built
    concurrently.
# Builds
- [ ] Having a `setup.dats` file would be nice.
# Targets
- [ ] Add first-class support for compiling various types of libraries (`.a`,
  `.so`, `.o`, etc.)
# Other languages
- [ ] Need a relatively pain-free way to add support for other languages
